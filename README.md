# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

Compiled using [Dotfiles Manager](https://github.com/rucker/dotfiles-manager).

Note: usage of [dotfiles.sh](dotfiles.sh) depends on GNU `readlink` and `realpath`. On MacOS, these can be installed via Homebrew's `coreutils` package (and the `gnubin` dir must be added to `$PATH` as described [here](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils)).
