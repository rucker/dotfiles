# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

Compiled using [Dotfiles Manager](https://github.com/rucker/dotfiles-manager).

## TODO / Wishlist:
- If `dfm` is not on `$PATH`, put it there (with user confirmation)
- Walk user through creating gitconfig_local (`[user]` section)
